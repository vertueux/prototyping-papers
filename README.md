  Prototyping Papers
</h1>

Prototyping Papers is a set of LaTeX papers designed to help you write notes, small documents, memos, etc. All A4 templates are ready to download and print, via the `preview/` folder.

The simplicity of the programming done on these files makes them highly customizable and can be easily adapted to your wishes.

## Compile the LaTeX files

To build the files yourself, you'll need a LaTeX edition with font support (notably XeLaTex). That's why I recommend using Overleaf to edit and compile programs from the web. All you have to do is clone the GitHub repository from the site.
